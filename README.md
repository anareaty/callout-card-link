# Callout Card Link

It is a fork of [Auto Card Link](https://github.com/nekoshita/obsidian-auto-card-link) plugin. It fetches link metadata and presents it as a card, but unlike the original plugin it uses callout instead of codeblock.

Benefits of callout approach:
- keeps working if the plugin is deleted;
- can use local images;
- can contain some additional elements.

Downsides:
- card itself is not clickable;
- looks less clean in the source view.
